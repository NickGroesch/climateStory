# climateStory

As a user I want to visualize the effects that covid-19 has had on vehicle travel and air quality, to see if any significant correlation exists.

## inspirations

    https://www.bts.gov/covid-19/week-in-transportation these data visualizations are, by definition, good enough for government work!

    some old youtube video of nuclear explosions on a world map, by country. ~70years scales to ~10 minutes. could I do this with heatmaps?

## setting perspective

    tell the historical story of the past epidemics climactic impact, particularly the old world black death and then new world columbian decimation, leading to winters so cold the swedes marched over the ice to conquer denmark (if i remember right)

    tell the story of a society where "social scientific consciousness" grapples with "impositions on individual liberty". if covid doesn't have a silver lining, maybe it's at least less brown.
